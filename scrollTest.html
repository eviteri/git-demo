                            Michael Cohen is a certifiable liar. That much we know because he has pleaded guilty to it, and the Republicans
                            on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform reminded us of it incessantly during Wednesday's committee
                            hearing.
                            The viewers will have to judge how much, if any, of Cohen's testimony about President Donald Trump they accept.
                            But I found the frantic efforts of Trump's rabid defenders to dismiss Cohen as a "pathological criminal" curious
                            in one major respect: This is the same man Donald Trump kept by his side for a decade, to handle his most
                            sensitive assignments — to handle clandestine deals and make bad stories go away.

                                    Michael Cohen is a certifiable liar. That much we know because he has pleaded guilty to it, and the Republicans
                                    on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform reminded us of it incessantly during Wednesday's committee
                                    hearing.
                                    The viewers will have to judge how much, if any, of Cohen's testimony about President Donald Trump they accept.
                                    But I found the frantic efforts of Trump's rabid defenders to dismiss Cohen as a "pathological criminal" curious
                                    in one major respect: This is the same man Donald Trump kept by his side for a decade, to handle his most
